In my preview, I have successfully created somewhat of a circle/herd of sheep. I did this by adding an alpha channel,
using the lasso tool, and cutting out the surrounding part of the image. I made the herd of sheep appear large by 
having the front image bigger than the back images. This also creates a sense of depth. I also wanted the herd to be in the front
because this establishes hierarchy. Herd immunity is my main argument so I want the first thing the audience to look at to be the herd. 
By looking at the herd first, you should then see the children in the middle of them. Finally, you will see the parents.
The images I have so far still need touching up because you can see some of the background 
behind the sheep and it doesn't match the new background. Furthermore, I added two images of children that are inside the circle of sheep.
I don't really like the way the second child in the wonder woman outfit looks. The first child seems to blend in pretty well. 
I still need to add images of angry parents holding weapons, and I need to add the text. I plan on having text at the top which 
would be read first, saying "there's more than one way to protect your children". Then, I will have text at the bottom that will say 
"vaccinate". I still have not determined what kind of font to use that will support the portrayal of my argument.
My biggest concern is to figure out how to make the cut images blend more into the background. 
I also am not sure how to make this image more creative and make it pop to the audience. 
Thus, the image still needs a significant amount of work done, but I'm generally happy with what I have so far.
